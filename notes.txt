# Decisions overall: 
"Polity" not included currently. 

# Decisions specifics:
## questionrelation: 
* Map to another number currently. 
* (notes): 417 question_id are not in questionrelations (but in answerset). 
--> Some of this is definitely a mistake. 
--> Especially the text poll has problems. 

## regions: 
--> using the n=10 world regions from Rachel
--> based on overlap with countries
--> n=4 cases lacking geom object.
--> using regions that are not "completed" (n=27 cases in our data) 

## answerset: 
--> seems to be true that if there is "history_parent_id" then answer is outdated (filter out directly)
--> how about inferring a no if parent is no? (leave to user?)

## other problems:
--> why is branching question such a mess?
--> should this not just have 7 possible values?

Notes for myself:
Editor does in fact not have to be unique to an entry. 
There can be more than 1 so it should be in the answerset. 

need to migrate "data source" to entries....
